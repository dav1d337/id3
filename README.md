- `Main.java` will execute the ID3 Algorithm for the given CSV-File (given as system argument) and prints the resulting DecisionTree to the console. Additionally, it will create a .dot in the project folder which can be converted to a .png by using https://www.graphviz.org/
- You can change the target attribute for classification in the second parameter of `runAlgorithm()` call.
